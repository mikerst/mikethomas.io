Ahoy! I'm Mike Thomas, an interdisciplinary designer in London.

I've been involved in crafting experiences for the web for over ten years. My favorite bit is the part where you get to start actually building things — architecting HTML, SASS/CSS and Javascript — regardless of the size or scale of the project.

I graduated with honours with a degree in Graphic Design from Bournemouth, and later completed a Masters in Digital Art and Technology from Plymouth. 

After I'd spent several years freelancing in my hometown, I got a call from a friend on a rainy Friday in December 2008 about an opportunity to work at Metaphors, a boutique brand agency in Holland Park. I decided to grab the opportunity with both hands and I started the following Monday. 

During my time there I was exposed to a myriad of clients large and small — ranging from local building contractors featured on Grand Designs, to gargantuan logistics companies operating globally. My duties required wearing mulitple hats, and any given week could include designing pitch materials to aid new business acquisition, building static HTML/CSS or providing face to face training and support to key clients across Europe.

In 2013 I moved to Media Ingenuity, a Sunday Times Tech Track 100 business operating in the financial sector. Now known as TotallyMoney.com, I am currently working as a lead designer for an in-house, cross-functional team charged with creating innovative new tools designed to empower consumers to make smarter, fairer financial decisions. I'm currently spending my time developing a consistent design language for the business, including archtecting well-documented and maintainable LESS—the occasional refactor notwithstanding—as well as workign with product, ux design, and crm leads to create mockup flows for the new services we're building.
