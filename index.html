			<h1 class="glitch">Mike Thomas is an interdisciplinary designer and writer in London.</h1>

			<p>
				Currently working for TotallyMoney.com, I've worked with a ridiculously long list of clients over the years. I don't use Dribbble, slay dragons in my sleep, run my own micro-agency called SIGIL. I believe firmly in keeping hearts on sleeves and tongues in cheeks.
