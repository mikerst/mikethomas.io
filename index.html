			<p>Hi there, I'm Mike, a multiple-hat-wearing designer living and working in London. I'm in the process of reimagining my personal site however in the mean time you can learn a bit more about me below. If you have any further questions, or just want to get in touch, grab me on <a target="_blank" title="grab me on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mikerst">twitter</a>, or send me an <a target="_blank" title="send me an email" href="mailto: mikerst@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>I'm currently a Senior Designer at TotallyMoney.com</strong>, working on a variety of different projects across the business, ranging from UI design for new products, through to completely overhauling our email design and development workflow.</p>
			<p><strong>I have a broad range of high-end skills</strong>, and can slot in mostly anywhere within the product design cycle, whether that be distilling project requirements in to coherent and useful wireframes, mocking up high-fidility visuals, prototyping animations or writing big-project-friendly LESS/CSS.</p>
			<p><strong>I've worked professionally as a designer in various forms since 2005</strong>. I've been self-employed, agency side and in-house (as well as a mixture of both) and have been lucky enough to have worked with some big-ticket clients over the years. I'm as good at getting my hands dirty on the nuts and bolts of a project as I am at building, organising and motivating a team.</p>
			<p><strong>I've worked with a lot of organisations, big and small</strong>. While I'm not the rock'n'roll, keynote-speaking Ãœbermensch type with Apple, Google, Facebook and a lucrative book-deal on my CV (watch this space), I'm proud to have a client list including brands such as MBNA, Capital One, DB Schenker, FOX, Cognita Schools, TotallyMoney.com and even the NHS.</p>
			<p><strong>I come replete with opinions</strong>, here are a few of them...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The front-endification of design is a good thing. But with great power, comes great responsibility! Pick the right tool for the job. </li>
				<li>No processes > <em>too many</em> processes.</li>
				<li>Process and Method are not the same thing (good recurring processes help facilitate a good methodology).</li>
				<li>Common sense and intuition are just as valuable in making decisions as hard data. Gut instinct shouldn't be ignored.</li>
				<li>Your users should always come first, but they are not always right.</li>
				<li>Better Call Saul is a better show than Breaking Bad. Yep.</li>
				<li>It is ok to say you're 'going to the bathroom' even if no bath is present in that room.</li>
			</ul>
