		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>I’m a designer closing in on nine years of experience working both in-house and self-employed. Originally from Devon, England, I’ve been based in London since late 2008. I’m fortunate to have worked with a broad variety of clients, ranging from maverick start-ups to large and far reaching global organisations. I frequently get to apply myself across the whole gamut of user experience practices, from planning user journeys, designing coherent UI concepts for presentation to clients and key stakeholders, or writing clean and maintainable front-end code.</p>
		<p>I am a passionate and opinionated person, and I am extremely fortunate in that I get paid to do what I love.</p>
